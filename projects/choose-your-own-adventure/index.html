<h1>Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Project</h1>

<h2 class="first">The gravel road leads to a village, its tall houses dark as tombstones. Nestled among these solemn dwellings are a handful of closed-up shops. Even the tavern is shut tight. A soft whimpering draws your eye toward a pair of children standing in the middle of an otherwise lifeless street.  Click 'approach' if you want to go near or you can decide to 'run away'.</h2>

<button id="approach" type="button">Approach</button>
<button id="run" type="button">Run away</button>

<div class="second">
<h2 id="run-answer">Your mother would be ashamed.  You better approach.</h2>
</div>

<div class="third">
<h2 id="approach-answer">Rose is clutching a small doll.  After shushing the boy, the girl turns to you and says, `There’s a monster in our house!` She then points to a tall brick row house that has seen better days. Its windows are dark. It has a gated portico on the ground floor, and the rusty gate is slightly ajar. Do you 'go in' or 'question' the children?</h2>
</div>


<button id="go" type="button">Go In</button>
<button id="question" type="button">Question</button>

<div class="fourth">
<h2 id="go-answer">As you head through the main hall, you notice a spiral staircase leading to a second floor.  Do you 'head upstairs' or 'explore below'?
</div>

<div class="fifth">
<h2 id="question-answer">Rose and Thorn say that they won’t go back in the house until they know the monster is gone. You better go in.</h2>
</div>

<button id="upstairs" type="button">Head Upstairs</button>
<button id="explore" type="button">Explore Below</button>

<div class="sixth">
  <h2 id="upstairs-answer">You find yourself in the master bedroom. Resting on the yellowed tablecloth is an empty porcelain bowl and a matching jug.  The door facing the foot of the bed has a full-length mirror mounted on it. The door opens to reveal an empty, dust-choked closet. A door in the parlor leads to an outside balcony.  Do you need to 'smoke' outside or 'check' the other rooms?</h2>
</div>

<div class="seventh">
  <h2 id="explore-answer">You step on a loose floorboard and slip into the basement unconscious.  Sorry--game over.</h2>
</div>

<button id="smoke" type="button">Smoke Outside</button>
<button id="check" type="button">Check the Others</button>

<div class="eighth">

<h2 id="check-answer">You head down a narrow passageway into what appears to be servant's quarters.An undecorated bedroom contains a pair of beds with straw-stuffed mattresses. At the foot of each bed is an empty footlocker. Tidy servants’ uniforms hang from hooks in the adjoining closet.  Do you 'open' the locker or 'redecorate' the room?</h2>
